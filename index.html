                    <p>The history of human civilization is <b style="color: #3b538c;">entwined</b> with the history of ways we have learned to manipulate water resources. 
                        As towns gradually expanded, water was brought from increasingly remote sources, leading to sophisticated engineering efforts such as dams and aqueducts. 
                        At the height of the Roman Empire, nine major systems, with an innovative layout of pipes and well-built sewers, supplied the occupants of Rome with as much water per person as is provided in many parts of the industrial world today.

                <div class="section">
                    <div class="title">Paragraph C</div>
                    <div class="lineh"></div>
                    <p>Yet there is a dark side to this picture: despite our progress, half of the world's population still suffers, with water services inferior to those available to the ancient Greeks and Romans. 
                        As the United Nations report on access to water reiterated in November 2001, more than one billion people lack access to clean drinking water: some two and half billion do not have <b style="color: #3b538c;">adequate</b> sanitation services. 
                        Preventable water-related diseases kill an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 children every day, and the latest evidence suggests that we are falling behind in efforts to solve their problems.

                    <p>The consequences of our water policies extend beyond <b style="color: #3b538c;">jeopardizing</b> human health. 
                        Tens of millions of people have been forced to move from their homes - often with little warning or compensation - to make way for the reservoirs behind dams. 
                        More than 20% of all freshwater fish species are now threatened or endangered because dams and water withdrawals have destroyed the free-flowing river ecosystems where they thrive. 
                        Certain irrigation practices degrade soil quality and reduce agricultural productivity. 
                        Groundwater aquifers* are being pumped down faster than they are naturally replenished in part of India, China, the USA and elsewhere. 
                        And disputes over shared water resources have led to violence and continue to raise local, national and even international tensions.
